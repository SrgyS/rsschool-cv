# About Me:

I've experienced in various fields. After graduation, I worked as a cell phone repairman for almost six years. After that I decided to change my line of work and went into sales. I worked as a car salesman for over 10 years. Now I decided to change the field of activity again. My goal is to become a front-end developer. Technical background and education help me in learning new knowledge and skills. I enjoy solving problems. Soft skills and sense of humor are also my strong points.
